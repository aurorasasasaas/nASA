                    <h2>About the Game</h2>
                    <p>The Cosmic Quest game is designed for 2 to 5 players, ages 8 and up. In this exciting board game, players will navigate through 15 colorful planets inspired by NASA challenges. Each player will draw cards based on the color of the planet they land on, answering questions to progress towards the finish line, "The Sun".</p>

                    <h2>How to Play</h2>
                    <p>The game begins with the "Mom" or instructor, who will have the brochure containing the answers and will judge the players' responses. Players take turns rolling a die to determine how many spaces to move forward. Here’s how the game works:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Each player rolls the die. The player with the highest roll goes first, followed by the others in descending order.</li>
                        <li>On your turn, roll the die and move forward the number of spaces rolled.</li>
                        <li>Upon landing on a planet, draw a card corresponding to that color and read the question aloud.</li>
                        <li>If you answer correctly, you stay on that spot. If you answer incorrectly, you return to your previous position before rolling the die.</li>
                        <li>The first player to reach "The Sun" wins!</li>
                    </ol>
